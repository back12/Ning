### Translate the App

If you want to translate the app in your language: great!

Translatable text is located in two places:

- All strings used in the app are located under https://github.com/csicar/Ning/tree/master/app/src/main/res

- The app description for F-Droid etc. are located under https://github.com/csicar/Ning/tree/master/fastlane/metadata/android

### Development in Android Studio

The project should be easy to import in Android Studio: Just clone the repository and import it.

### Build Vendor DB
```bash
go run createMacVendorDB.go
```
